# Image Processor for Relief Printmaking

[Relief printmaking](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/relief-print#:~:text=A%20general%20term%20for%20those,and%20rubber%20or%20metal%20stamping) is an art form where artists carve into a printing surface, leaving the remaining raised area to interact with ink and create the print. Relief prints include woodcut, linocut, and rubber stamping. As a novice in this art form, I built this tool to aid in reasoning about designs and how they may translate into prints.

## Features

Given a target image, the tool
- creates a black and white version to simulate how the image might appear when printed and
- inverts the black and white image to create visual representation of the areas that need to be carved out for printmaking.
